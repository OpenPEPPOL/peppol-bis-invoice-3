[[projectref]]
= Project reference

The project reference is optional to use, and is sent in an invoice in the element `cac:ProjectReference/cbc:ID`. In a credit note, this element does not exist, and project reference
is sent by using the element `cac:AdditionalDocumentReference[cbc:DocumentTypeCode='50']/cbc:ID`.

NOTE:: When sending the project reference, only the `cbc:ID` and the `cbc:DocumentTypeCode` are allowed in the `cac:AdditionalDocumentReference` element.
