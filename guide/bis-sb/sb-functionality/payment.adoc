= Payment

A self-billed invoice represents a claim for payment. The issuance of a self-billed invoice may take place either before or after the payment is carried out. When a self-billed invoice is issued before payment it represents a request to the Buyer to pay, in which case the self-billed invoice commonly contains information that enables the Buyer, in the role of a debtor, to correctly initiate the transfer of the payment, unless that information is already agreed in prior contracts or by means of payment instructions separately lodged with the Buyer.

If a self-billed invoice is issued after payment, such as when the order process included payment instructions or when paying with a credit card, online or telephonic purchases, the self-billed invoice may contain information about the payment made in order to facilitate self-billed invoice to payment reconciliation on the Seller side. A self-billed invoice may be partially paid before issuing such as when a pre-payment is made to confirm an order.

Self-billed invoices, conformant with this specification should identify the means of payment for settlement of the self-billed invoice and clearly state what payment amount is requested. They should provide necessary details to support bank transfers in accordance with the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) for payments in Euro and the relevant national payment practices for other currencies. Payments by means of Credit Transfer, Direct debit, and Payment Card are in scope.
