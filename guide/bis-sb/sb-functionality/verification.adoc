This process forms part of the Buyer’s internal business controls. The self-billed invoice shall refer to an authentic commercial transaction. Support for self-billed invoice verification is a key function of an self-billed invoice. The self-billed invoice should provide sufficient information to look up relevant existing documentation, electronic or paper, for example, and as applicable:

* the relevant purchase order
* the contract
* the call for tenders, that was the basis for the contract
* the Buyer’s reference
* the confirmed receipt of the goods or services
* delivery information

An self-billed invoice should also contain sufficient information that allows the received self-billed invoice to be transferred to a responsible authority, person or department, for verification and approval.
