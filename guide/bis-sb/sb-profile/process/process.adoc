= General self-billing process

The self-billed invoicing process includes issuing and sending the invoice and the credit note from the customer to the supplier and the reception and handling of the same at the suppliersâ€™s site.

The self-billing process is shown in this work flow:

* A customer issues and sends an invoice in its suppliers name and sends it to the supplier. The self-billed invoice refers to the suppliers goods or services which have been consumed by the customer based on his own records.

A self-billed invoice may also refer to a contract or a frame agreement. The self-billed invoice may specify articles (goods and services) with article number or article description.

* The customer raises the invoice in the suppliers name and processes it as a purchase invoice, as having been received from the supplier.
  .. The customer books the invoice as a purchase.
  .. The customer books the invoice as accounts payable.
* The supplier receives the self-billed invoice and processes it as revenue in the sales control system leading to one of the following results:
  .. The supplier fully approves the self-billed invoice, posts it in the accounting system as revenue and accounts receivable.
  .. The supplier completely rejects the self-billed invoice, contacts the supplier and requests a self-billed credit note.
  .. The supplier disputes parts of the self-billed invoice, contacts the supplier and requests a self-billed credit note and/or a new self-billed invoice.

The diagram below shows the basic self-billing process with the use of this Peppol BIS profile. This process assumes that both the self-billed invoice and the self-billed credit note are exchanged electronically.
