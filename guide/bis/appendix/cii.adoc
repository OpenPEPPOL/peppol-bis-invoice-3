[appendix]
= Cross Industry Invoice

This {peppol} BIS supports the *optional* use of the UN/CEFACT XML Cross Industry Invoice, D16B (CII), meaning that receivers of invoices can register in the SMP to receive CII invoices alongside the mandatory UBL version.

All invoice instances expressed in CII shall be compliant to the restrictions and rules made by this BIS, and hence a CII instance document, shall be validated against the PEPPOL specific rules, just as the UBL instance documents.

Specification identifier (BT-24) and business process type (BT-23) are the same in a CII instance as for the UBL instance, see <<prof-01>>
