= Delivery Details (Date and Location)

Delivery details may be given at document level.

Place and date of delivery is recommended, and should be sent unless this does not affect the ability to ensure the correctness of the invoice.

The delivery element contains information on name, address and delivery location identifier (`cac:Delivery/cac:DeliveryLocation/cbc:ID`) which may be used if the place of delivery is  defined through an identifier.  Examples are GLN (Global Location Number) or GSRN (Global Service Relationship Number) both issued by GS1.
