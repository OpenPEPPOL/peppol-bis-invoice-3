= Binary objects

Binary objects can be used to describe files which are transmitted together with the Invoice. The attachments are underpinning the XML document.

Attachments shall be transmitted together with the Invoice. The binary object has two supplementary components: a Mime Code, which specifies the Mime type of the attachment and a Filename that is provided by (or on behalf of) the sender of the invoice or credit note.
