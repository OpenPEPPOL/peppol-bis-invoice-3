= Negative invoices and credit notes


In line with requirements of {EN16931} this BIS supports negative grand totals in order to open up for a wider spectrum of invoicing processes.

Examples of such processes are

* Preliminary (estimated) consumption invoice that is balanced out in a later meter-based invoice;
* Pre-payment (with or without VAT) is settled through a final invoice; and
* Some user communities prefer to use negative invoice rather than credit note when correcting transactions.

This has the following implications on the transaction format:

* The invoice (now with “negative invoice capacity”) can function as an alternative to the credit note. Invoice-generating systems may implement either option, while invoice-receiving systems have to support both of them.
*	The transaction format for credit note has to be designed to accommodate for negative grand total, as well; this is because an entire negative invoice may have to be balanced out by means of a credit note.

Attention is drawn to the intrinsic differences between credit note and negative invoice when it comes to convey crediting information.
