= Code list for invoice type code (BT-3)

The following sub-chapters give an overview of the restricted set of invoice type codes (BT-3) that is used in this PEPPOL BIS Billing.

The table indicates the name and description of each code, as well as a column "Synonym with" to indicate how this invoice type can be processed if the recipient does not have a separate process/work flow for this code, and as you will see, all invoice types valid in this profile can be processed as a commercial invoice (380) and all credit note types as Commercial credit note (381). Some recipients might have separate processes or work flows for some of these types, and can then use these processes.

The table also gives information on what message type is to be used in the UBL syntax  for the different codes.
