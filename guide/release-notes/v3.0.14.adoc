= Version 3.0.14
[horizontal]
Release date:: 2022-11-03

== Changes to BIS document
* Editorial change in the documentaion templates. Many pages in previous releases had a "Last updated" timestamp in the page footer. The timestamp indicated when the HTML-page was generated by the documentation tool, not when the actual content of the page was updated/changed. The timestamp is now removed since it caused a lot of confusion. 
* Example files added to zip-file that can be downloaded from the main page of the BIS.
