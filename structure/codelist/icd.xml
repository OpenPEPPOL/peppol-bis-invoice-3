This information is used by NATO and Sponsored nations' Logisticians to identify Commercial and Government Entities they deal with. This Information is used by all functions of Logistics support such as Acquisition, Sourcing, EDI, Re-Provisioning, Material Management, etc. Determination of the real source for an item of supply is one of the most important prerequisites for proper application of the Uniform System of Item Identification within NATO. It is the source where documentation will be obtained from and its location normally gives advice for codification responsibility. Within the NATO Codification System the term Manufacturer covers the whole range of possible sources of technical data for items entering the supply chains or participating, countries. The primary use of manufacturers coding is in ADP operations related to support management programs such as material management codification, standardization, etc. Issuing agency: NATO Group of National Director on Codification (AC/135), Luxembourg.</Description>
